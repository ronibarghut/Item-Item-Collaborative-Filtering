# Item-Item-Collaborative-Filtering
A system that implements the Item based collaborative filtering
a system for implementing Item Based Collaborative filtering, 
An algorithm for recommending additional products for the customer while visiting a website for example.

Why Item-Based Collaborative Filtering? 
Compared to other algorithms such as User-Based CF , it requires less as complexity, more efficent.

This algorithm is widely used by the top and biggest well known websites apps and systems(Amazon , YouTube , NetFlix and more..)
In this project I have developed this algorith as an system with a user-friendly interfaces, which all you have to do is 
upload to the system, the data base that include the purchases for all the customers including the rating about the products the customers
have bought!
the system will run over this data base, after importing the data, and will perform the algorith and will export a new database that 
include for each product, 3 top related products to show.
